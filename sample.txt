##The diagram above visualizes a repositry with two isolated lines of development ,one for a little
features and one for a longer-running features, by developing them branches, its not only possible 
to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main master branch free of enter.

##Each task has one separate Branch.

##After down with code, merge other Branches with Master.

##This concept is useful for parallel development.

##Changes are personal to that praticular Branch.

##Defualt branch is 'Master'

##File created in workspace will be visible in any of the brach workspace untill you commit once
you commit, then that file belongs to that particular Branch.
